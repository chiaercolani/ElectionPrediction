    "# 1 Problem Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "Nowadays social medias like Twitter and Facebook are means by which people continuously express their opinion on any matter. Thus, data mining combined with data analysis could be a great way to undersand the general feeling of the users on a certian matter.\n",
    "With this in mind, we decided to try to predict the result of an election using data from Twitter.\n",
    "\n",
    "We focused on the US Senate Election of 2016, since this election would provide enough meaningful data for our analysis. In fact there are many candidates and a lot of people are tweeting about them, allowing us to have a big dataset to train our algorithm with. We started by mining data from Twitter, collecting every Tweet regarding most of the Republican and Democrate Senate candidates during the two months preceeding the elections. We collected tweets aimed at each candidate, meaning tweets containing the candidate's twitter name . \n",
    "\n",
    "The second step was to perform a sentiment analysis on these tweets to understand if the user was expressing a positive or negative feeling towards the candidate. Sentiment analysis combines natural language processing, text analysis and computational linguistics to assess the attitude of a writer towards a topic. There are various tools for it, we picked one called Pattern developed by the University of Antwerp, in Belgium. \n",
    "\n",
    "Afterwards we trained two variations of the same machine learning algorithm with the sentiment analysis data and some other features like number of followers of the candidate. \n"

    "The tool is a Python script found on GitHub (link in the *Resources* section). It enabled us to get all the tweets in a desired time frame according to some custom parameters. For example to mine tweets about Evan Bayh from the 8th of Septemebr 2016 to the 8th of November 2016 we simply ran the following command:\n",

The goal of this step is to reduce the number of features that we will use for the prediction because we have to many of them compared to the amount of data available. We tried multiple orders for the AR fitting and chose the one that outputs the best prediction result.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second step consists in the prediction itself. First we concatenate the AR model coefficients with the extra features which are number of followers, number of unique author of tweets and total amount of tweets. The idea of using these extra features came from some papers we read about the Election Prediction topic. Then we fit a linear regression model between the features and the actual percentage of votes that the candidate received.\n",

This means that each time we train the coefficients on a reduced training set and test it on the value that was left out. If the prediction is correct, we keep the coefficients. At the end we average all the coefficients. \n",
    "After the model is trained, we apply it on the test set and we count the number of successful predictions and the total number of tries. The success of the prediction depends on the algorithm.\n",

    "# 6 Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "Sentiment Analysis, like any other natural language processing tool, is hard to perform and does not give extremely accurate results. Performing it on Tweets is tricky because many slang words are used and often the analysis does not output anything. Moreover the sentiment analysis of tweets like \"I hate how @Trump denies the work of @Obama. He is so stupid\" and \"I hate how @Obama denies the work of @Trump. He is so stupid\" give the same result. However the real meaning is opposite. If a tweet is perceived as negative, it does not mean that the negativity is towards the topic of tweet itself. We were aware of this problem, but thought that it would have been interesting to play with this tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another issue that we encountered was that the number of tweets differed a lot depending on the popularity of the candidate. However, since we looked at big elections in a big country, we were able to have a quite big dataset even though we did not consider every candidate, since some of them were not active at all on Twitter. \n",
    "\n",
    "Both algorithms reach with the right tunning a level of accuracy of 65%, which means that there is a weak correlation between the Twitter data and the result of the election. This poor result has multiple explainations, one of them is the imprecision of the sentiment analysis. Another reason is that the Twitter population is not a good sample of the voting people. Moreover tweets do not always represent the point of view of the author, sometimes they can just be provocative. Finally the author of tweets may not have the right to vote in the election they are talking about. All these reasons, combined with a relatively small dataset, contributed in the obtained result.\n",
    "\n",
    "For further improvements of this work, a bigger dataset would be helpful to train more the machine learning algorithm. Moreover, a different sentiment analysis tool could be exploited.\n"
